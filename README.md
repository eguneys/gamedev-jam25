### Day 1: Setting Foundations
**Hour 1:**  
- Implement advanced movement mechanics (ledge grab, smoother jumps).  
- Begin testing movement to ensure responsiveness.  

**Hour 2:**  
- Design and implement enemy mechanics (knockback, interactions).  
- Build basic AI behaviors for the two enemies.  

**Hour 3:**  
- Create tile art, ensuring visual consistency across background and foreground elements.  
- Integrate tiles into the level layout.  

**Hour 4:**  
- Start background art, focusing on the larger structures.  
- Develop parallax effects for depth.  

**Hour 5:**  
- Design character art (protagonist).  
- Ensure animations for advanced movement are working (ledge grab, jumps).  

**Hour 6:**  
- Develop sword attack mechanics (art + code) with animation for fluidity.  
- Begin integrating collectibles (art + basic coding).

### Day 2: Polish and Finalize
**Hour 1:**  
- Finish enemy art and polish their mechanics.  
- Test enemy knockback and interaction systems thoroughly.  

**Hour 2:**  
- Implement FX art and coding (sword attack, enemy impacts).  
- Polish the background and foreground art details.  

**Hour 3:**  
- Build cohesive level design, focusing on flow and placement of collectibles/enemies.  
- Ensure levels reflect difficulty progression.  

**Hour 4:**  
- Create menu screen (start, pause, endgame) and transitions.  
- Test and refine basic UI navigation.  

**Hour 5:**  
- Finalize and integrate the collectibles art + code.  
- Complete and polish parallax effects.  

**Hour 6:**  
- Conduct a full playtest of the game. Address bugs and refine any rough areas.  
- Add final touches to visuals and gameplay elements.
